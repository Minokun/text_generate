	The weather in Guangzhou is very good. There are four seasons in Guangzhou. They are spring, summer, autumn and winter.

	It’s warm and wet in spring. And it’s very hot in summer. Autumn is from September to November. It’s very dry in autumn. You should drink more water. Winter is my favourite season. You just wear a jacket or a coat. Unlike many other countries. It’s not too cold in Guangzhou. Many people like travelling to Guangzhou in winter. I go skating and cycling every day. My grandpa and grandma usually stay in Guangzhou in winter. Because it’s warm.【星火作文网 www.easyzw.com】
